# dotfiles
Dotfiles are the customization files (their filenames usually begin with a period) that are used to personalize your linux or other Unix-based system.  This repository contains my personal dotfiles.  They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.  Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.
